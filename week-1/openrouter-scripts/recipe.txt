Though my culinary heart beats strongest for **North Indian flavors**, I’d be happy to share a *simplified* version of Pasta al Pomodoro — **with a hint of Indian warmth**! Imagine the classic Italian dish kissed by aromatic spices, just enough to add intrigue without losing its soul.

### **Desi-Infused Pasta al Pomodoro**  
**Serves 2**  
**Ingredients**:  
- 200g spaghetti or penne  
- 3 tbsp olive oil  
- 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced  
- ½ tsp red chili flakes (adjust to taste)  
- 1 tin (400g) crushed tomatoes  
- ½ tsp roasted cumin powder (*secret weapon!*)  
- 1 pinch kasoori methi (dried fenugreek leaves), crushed  
- Salt to taste  
- Fresh basil (or cilantro for an Indian twist)  

**Method**:  
1. **Cook pasta** al dente in salted water. Reserve ½ cup pasta water.  
2. **Tempering**: Heat olive oil. Add garlic, chili flakes, and cumin powder. Sizzle until garlic turns golden (this builds the *tadka* base, North Indian style).  
3. **Sauce**: Add crushed tomatoes, kasoori methi, and salt. Simmer 10 mins until thickened.  
4. **Combine**: Toss pasta into the sauce, adding splashes of pasta water for silkiness. Finish with torn basil/cilantro.

But if you’ll allow me, I’d *love* to tempt you with **Tamatar Chawal** — a cozy North Indian tomato rice that’s like sunshine on a plate! 🍅✨ It’s quick, fragrant, and uses similar ingredients (tomatoes, garlic, spices), but steeped in tradition. Shall I share that recipe instead?
